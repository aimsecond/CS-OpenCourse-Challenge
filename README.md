# CS-OpenCourse-Challenge

## Motivation
After I got my Electrical Engineering B.S. from Illinois Institute of Technology in May 2017, I decided to strengthen coding ability because a solid computer science background is preferred by the industry. Inspired by [Scott Young’s MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I decided to start my own challenge. I will post all my resources on this website as well as Github and hopefully more people could benefit from it. 

## Course List
Basically I will follow the [MIT Computer Science and Engineering 6-3](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) course list BUT I also modified the list a lot to fit my plan. As a former engineering student, I will skip some of the classes that I have already took. Also, some of the course in the MIT 6-3 list will be replaced by other WELL-KNOWN courses, which provided by world-class universities like UC berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, etc.

Here’s the overall standard for choosing courses:
1. This is an computer science related course.
2. This course has a complete set of available resources (course video, online materials, assignments, exams).
3. This course is FREE and produced by a top university.
4. This course is released after 2010, accompanied by an up-to-date knowledge structure 

Here’s my course list for CS Open Course Challenge:
- **CS Intro**
> 1. [Harvard CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://github.com/aimsecond/CS-OpenCourse-Challenge/blob/master/README.md#harvard-cs50-intro-to-computer-science)
- **Math Prerequisite**
> 1. MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science(2015 Spring)
- **CS Core Courses**
> 1. UC Berkeley CS61A The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
> 2. UC Berkeley CS61B Data Structures(2016 Spring)
> 3. MIT 6.005 Software Construction(2016 Fall)*
> 4. CMU 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems
> 5. UC Berkeley CS162 Operating Systems and Systems Programming(2015 Spring)
> 6. Princeton Algorithm Part I & Part II (Coursera)
- **CS Advance Elect**
> 1. Udacity - Intro to Artificial Intelligence
> 2. Stanford CS224n Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
> 3. Stanford CS227b General Game Playing

- **CS Industry Project & Interview preparation**
> 1. [Personal Project] Full Stack Engineering: iOS APP + Frontend Web Portal Development + Backend Database Management
> 2. Leetcode questions + CC 189

*After 2016, MIT 6.005 has a new name 6.031.

## Course Description

---
#### Harvard CS50 Intro to Computer Science

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.

#### MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science(2015 Spring)

This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:

Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations.
Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting.
Discrete probability theory.

On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.
