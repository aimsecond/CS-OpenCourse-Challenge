# CS-OpenCourse-Challenge

# Motivation
After I got my Electrical Engineering B.S. from Illinois Institute of Technology in May 2017, I decide to strengthen coding ability because a solid computer science background is preferred by the industry. Inspired by [Scott Youngâ€™s MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I decided to start my own challenge. I will post all my resources on this website as well as Github and hopefully more people could benefit from it.
