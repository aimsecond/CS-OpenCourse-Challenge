# CS-OpenCourse-Challenge

## Motivation
After I got my Electrical Engineering B.S. from Illinois Institute of Technology in May 2017, I decide to strengthen coding ability because a solid computer science background is preferred by the industry. Inspired by [Scott Young’s MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I decided to start my own challenge. I will post all my resources on this website as well as Github and hopefully more people could benefit from it. 

## Course List
Basically I will follow the [MIT Computer Science and Engineering 6-3](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) course list BUT I also modified the list a lot to fit my plan. As a former engineering student, I will skip some of the classes that I have already took. Also, some of the course in the MIT 6-3 list will be replaced by other WELL-KNOWN courses, which provided by world-class universities like UC berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, etc.
Here’s the overall standard for choosing courses:
1.This is an computer science related course.
2.This course has a complete set of available resources (course video, online materials, assignments, exams).
3.This course is FREE and produced by a top university.
4.This course is released after 2010, accompanied by an up-to-date knowledge structure
