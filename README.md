# CS-OpenCourse-Challenge

## Motivation
After I got my Electrical Engineering B.S. from Illinois Institute of Technology in May 2017, I decided to strengthen coding ability because a solid computer science background is preferred by the industry. Inspired by [Scott Young’s MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I decided to start my own challenge. I will post all my resources on the Github and hopefully more people could benefit from it. 

## Course List
Basically I will follow the [MIT Computer Science and Engineering 6-3](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) course list BUT I also modified the list a lot to fit my plan. As a former engineering student, I will skip some of the classes that I have already took. Also, some of the course in the MIT 6-3 list will be replaced by other WELL-KNOWN courses, which provided by world-class universities like UC berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, etc.

Here’s the overall standard for choosing courses:
1. This is an computer science related course.
2. This course has a complete set of available resources (course video, online materials, assignments, exams).
3. This course is FREE and produced by a top university.
4. This course is released after 2010, accompanied by an up-to-date knowledge structure

#### MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science(2015 Spring)

This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:

Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations.
Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting.
Discrete probability theory.

On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

#### UC Berkeley CS61A The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

#### Stanford CS224n Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models behind NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this winter quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP. On the model side we will cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as some recent models involving a memory component. Through lectures and programming assignments students will learn the necessary engineering tricks for making neural networks work on practical problems. 

This course is a merger of Stanford's previous cs224n course (Natural Language Processing) and cs224d (Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing).

#### Stanford CS227b General Game Playing

General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime". (In other words, they don't know the rules until the games start.) General Game Playing (GGP) is an interesting application in its own right. It is intellectually engaging and more than a little fun. But it is much more than that. It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and resource bounds. It has practical applications in areas where these features are important, e.g. in business and law. More fundamentally, it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.

#### Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.
